# Java Port Scanner

This Java project simulates network reconnaissance by scanning TCP ports (1-1024) on a given IP address.

## Features
- Scans TCP ports to detect open services
- Demonstrates networking knowledge and cybersecurity skills
- Port scanning is a core skill in cybersecurity, demonstrates knowledge of networking, and fits your “Vulnerability Management” and “Incident Response” experience.

## Languages & Tools
- Java
- Socket programming (networking)
- MacOS compatible

## Usage
1. Compile: `javac PortScanner.java`
2. Run: `java PortScanner`
3. Enter the target IP address to scan

## Cybersecurity Relevance
This project simulates the reconnaissance phase in penetration testing.  
Open ports detected can be mapped to potential attacker TTPs using [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/), demonstrating understanding of real-world attack techniques and incident response workflows.
